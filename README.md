Module 20 Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

The purpose of this challenge is to test two Machine Learning Models and decide if either of them are good predictors of healthy or high-risk loans. The data set includes information about borrowers such as their DTI (debt-to-income), late payments, total loan amount, interest rate, and more. We split the data into training and test data to make predictions.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  Accuracy: 99%
  Precision for healthy loans: 100%
  Recall for healthy loans: 99%
  Precision for risky loans: 85%
  Recall for risky loans: 91%



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  Accuracy: 99%
  Precision for healthy loans: 100%
  Recall for healthy loans: 99%
  Precision for risky loans: 84%
  Recall for risky loans: 99%


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
The 2nd Machine Learning Model is performing much better. Although they have the same accuracy, the recall jumps to .99 from .91 on recall for risky loans in the 2nd model. This means fewer high-risk loans are being mislabeled as healthy by the model. This is a big deal to the bank as one of their main goals is to minimize risk. I would recommend the 2nd model.
